In this project, there are two files. 

In the "DataCodingExploration.ipynb" file, you'll find the development of all the code related to the data mining analysis.

In the "Project_Documentation" file, you'll see a step-by-step guide to all the analyses. I recommend reading this before diving 
into the "DataCodingExploration.ipynb" file for a clearer understanding."
